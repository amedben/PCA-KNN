# PCA-KNN
This project aims to demonstrate the use of the PCA algorithm (Principal component analysis) on a feature-rich data set.

We chose a waveform data set and performed a classification task on it using KNN(k-nearest neighbors), whilst incorporating PCA for visualisation and feature reduction.

The models were built using Python.
